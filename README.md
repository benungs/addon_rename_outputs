# Rename Outputs *(Blender Addon, tested on 3.4.0)*  
This Blender Addon creates a Search/Replace window in the Output panel of your Properties Window.  
Enter the Search String and Replace String, any matches will be replaced, both filenames and directory paths.  
The Scene Render as well as any Output Nodes will be updated.  
Install using the Blender Prefs (like you do any Addon).  
This is a simple text-based function. It is not OS specific.
